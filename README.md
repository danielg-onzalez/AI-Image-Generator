To develop the AI Image Generator, I progressed through a process that combined innovative technologies and creative problem-solving. The process involved several key steps:

OpenAI Integration:
I started by integrating OpenAI's DALLÂ·E model. This served as the foundation for generating images from text prompts.

User Interface Design:
To make the tool user-friendly, I designed a user interface that allows users to input text prompts effortlessly.

API Interaction:
Leveraging OpenAI's API, I developed a Python script that communicates with the GPT-3.5 model. This code sends user prompts to the API and receives image responses in return.

Timestamped File Naming:
To ensure each generated image remains distinct, I incorporated an automated file-naming system that appends timestamps to the saved image files.

Image Download Capability:
Users can conveniently download the generated images directly from the provided URL, enhancing the overall user experience.
