# AI-Image-Generator
The AI Image Generator uses a cutting-edge AI system and generates high-quality images from textual descriptions. The AI system integrates OpenAI's API to continually refine its understanding of the input text and produce images that can be comparable to those created by graphic designers.

To develop the AI Image Generator, I progressed through a process that combined innovative technologies and creative problem-solving. The process involved several key steps:

OpenAI Integration:
I started by integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5. This served as the foundation for generating images from text prompts.

User Interface Design:
To make the tool user-friendly, I designed a user interface that allows users to input text prompts effortlessly.

API Interaction:
Leveraging OpenAI's API, I developed a Python script that communicates with the GPT-3.5 model. This code sends user prompts to the API and receives image responses in return.

Timestamped File Naming:
To ensure each generated image remains distinct, I incorporated an automated file-naming system that appends timestamps to the saved image files.

Image Download Capability:
Users can conveniently download the generated images directly from the provided URL, enhancing the overall user experience.
